Despite enormous progress in lipreading recently, only 30% of the International Phonetic Alphabet is regarded directly related to lip movement.   On the other hand, environmental disturbances and individual differences are ubiquitous, which limits the quality of lipreading. To increase the performance, we propose a sparse reconstruction lipreading model by representing the lipreading information with the elements in the convolutional dictionary built on the image pathes. Our method exploits the use of differentiable optimization layers defined from convolutional sparse coding to  more robustly reconstruct the lipreading features. We design a series of robustness experiments on environmental disturbance and personalized disturbance data, and prove that the robustness of lipreading models can be improved with the high-dimensional reconstruction of features. In addition, compared with other methods on LRS2, LRS3 and ICSLR datasets, the sparse reconstruction based lipreading model performs much more robustly with lower word error rates in all test scenarios.
